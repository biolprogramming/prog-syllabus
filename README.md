## Course Description

The analysis of large data sets in biological research is becoming common, particularly as new sequencing technologies and data collection strategies exponentially increase the amount of data that can be collected by an individual researcher.  Programmatic approaches are often needed to format and analyze these large data sets, yet few biologists receive training in applying programming languages to these tasks.  Programming for Biologists is meant to _introduce_ graduate or advanced undergraduate students to the practice of computer programming as it is applied to biological problems using a common programming language (Python, R) and programmatic techniques and algorithms.

## Course Credo

This course **is** going to challenge _and_ frustrate you.  A lot.  I promise.  You are learning a new language really quickly - that's a hard thing to do.  Along with the hard parts of learning a new language, in this case, comes having to learn a number of new tools that you have not (likely) been exposed to.  That's also really hard.  You're also goingt to have to actually **think** on top of all that. But, if you think, and work, and collaborate with your classmates to understand what's going on, you **will** end up learning much, much more in a shorter period of time than you expected.

## Prerequisites

An interest in programming and a willingness to learn.

## Textbook

**Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist** by (Allen Downey)[http://www.allendowney.com/wp/]
[html](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)
[pdf](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf)

This is a freely-avialable textbook.  We will follow parts of it for the class.  It is also an invaluable reference text when you need to remind yourself of relatively simple Python details.

## Primary language

[Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.5.1

We are actually using the [Anaconda Python Distribution](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index).  You want to **be sure** to download and installed Python 3.5.x for your operating system (Linux/OSX/Windows).  The [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index) installers are linked, below:

* [OSX Installer](https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda3-2.4.1-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)
* [Windows Installer](https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda3-2.4.1-Windows-x86_64.exe)
* [Linux Installer](https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda3-2.4.1-Linux-x86_64.sh)

### Why are we using Python 3.5.x?

There exists a weird schism in the world where a now (much) older version of a programming language (Python 2.7.x) is used by many developers versus the newers (and mostly improved) version of that same language (Python 3.5.x).  The reasons for this are many and varied, but they largely dealt with the unavailability of many important packages in Python 3.5.x until "recently".

I would argue that the time is right for scientists to make the move to Python 3.5.x from Python 2.7.x.  So, we're starting that movement.  I also need to teach myself what has changed, and this is a pretty good way to do that.

### Why are we using Anaconda?

1. Because it generally "just works"
2. Offers package manager for installing packages it's missing
3. Has convenient "virtual" environments for testing
4. Comes with many important, precompiled/preinstalled packages (ipython, numpy, requests, etc.)


## Grading

In accordance with the LSU grading policy, grades will be assigned using an A-F scale and +/- system.  Grading is pretty simple:

                    | Value           | # of assignments  | % of grade
-------------       | -------------   | ----------------- | -------------
Class assignments   | 20 points/each  | 16                |
Code reviews        | 20 points/each  | 16                |
Project Proposal    | 100 points      | 1                 |
Final Project       | 200 points      | 1                 |
